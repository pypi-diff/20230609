+         "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
+         including but not limited to software source code, documentation
+         source, and configuration files.
+
+         "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
+         transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
+         not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
+         and conversions to other media types.
+
+         "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
+         Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
+         copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
+         (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
+
+         "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
+         form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
+         editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
+         represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the
+      purposes
+         of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
+         separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
+         the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
+
+         "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
+         the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
+         to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
+         submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
+         or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
+         the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
+         means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
+         to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
+         communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control
+      systems,
+         and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
+         Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
+         excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
+         designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
+
+         "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
+         on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
+         subsequently incorporated within the Work.
+
+      2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
+         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
+         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
+         copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
+         publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
+         Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
+
+      3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
+         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
+         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
+         (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
+         use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
+         where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
+         by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
+         Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
+         with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
+         institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
+         cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
+         or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
+         or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
+         granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
+         as of the date such litigation is filed.
+
+      4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
+         Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
+         modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
+         meet the following conditions:
+
+         (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
+             Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
+
+         (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
+             stating that You changed the files; and
+
+         (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
+             that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
+             attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
+             excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
+             the Derivative Works; and
+
+         (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
+             distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
+             include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
+             within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
+             pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
+             of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
+             as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
+             documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
+             within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
+             wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
+             of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
+             do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
+             notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
+             or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
+             that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
+             as modifying the License.
+
+         You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
+         may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
+         for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
+         for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
+         reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
+         the conditions stated in this License.
+
+      5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
+         any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
+         by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
+         this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
+         Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
+         the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
+         with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
+
+      6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
+         names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
+         except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
+         origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
+
+      7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
+         agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
+         Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
+         WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
+         implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
+         of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
+         PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
+         appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
+         risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
+
+      8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
+         whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
+         unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
+         negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
+         liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
+         incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
+         result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
+         Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
+         work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
+         other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
+         has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
+
+      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
+         the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
+         and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
+         or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
+         License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
+         on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
+         of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
+         defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
+         incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
+         of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

+# Entropy Coders for Research and Production
+
+The `constriction` library provides a set of composable entropy coding algorithms with a
+focus on correctness, versatility, ease of use, compression performance, and
+computational efficiency. The goals of `constriction` are three-fold:
+
+1. **to facilitate research on novel lossless and lossy compression methods** by
+   providing a *composable* set of primitives (e.g., you can can easily switch out a
+   Range Coder for an ANS coder without having to find a new library or change how you
+   represent exactly invertible entropy models);
+2. **to simplify the transition from research code to deployed software** by providing
+   similar APIs and binary compatible entropy coders for both Python (for rapid
+   prototyping on research code) and Rust (for turning successful prototypes into
+   standalone binaries, libraries, or WebAssembly modules); and
+3. **to serve as a teaching resource** by providing a variety of entropy coding
+   primitives within a single consistent framework. Check out our [additional teaching
+   material](https://robamler.github.io/teaching/compress21/) from a university course
+   on data compression, which contains some problem sets where you use `constriction`
+   (with solutions).
+
+**More Information:** [project website](https://bamler-lab.github.io/constriction)
+
+**Live demo:** [here's a web app](https://robamler.github.io/linguistic-flux-capacitor)
+that started out as a machine-learning research project in Python and was later turned
+into a web app by using `constriction` in a WebAssembly module).
+
+## Quick Start
+
+### Installing `constriction` for Python
+
+```bash
+pip install constriction~=0.3.1
+```
+
+### Hello, World
+
+You'll mostly use the `stream` submodule, which provides stream codes (like Range
+Coding or ANS). The following example shows a simple encoding-decoding round trip. More
+complex entropy models and other entropy coders are also supported, see section
+"More Examples" below.
+
+```python
+import constriction
+import numpy as np
+
+message = np.array([6, 10, -4, 2, 5, 2, 1, 0, 2], dtype=np.int32)
+
+# Define an i.i.d. entropy model (see below for more complex models):
+entropy_model = constriction.stream.model.QuantizedGaussian(-50, 50, 3.2, 9.6)
+
+# Let's use an ANS coder in this example. See below for a Range Coder example.
+encoder = constriction.stream.stack.AnsCoder()
+encoder.encode_reverse(message, entropy_model)
+
+compressed = encoder.get_compressed()
+print(f"compressed representation: {compressed}")
+print(f"(in binary: {[bin(word) for word in compressed]})")
+
+decoder = constriction.stream.stack.AnsCoder(compressed)
+decoded = decoder.decode(entropy_model, 9) # (decodes 9 symbols)
+assert np.all(decoded == message)
+```
+
+## More Examples
+
+### Switching Out the Entropy Coding Algorithm
+
+Let's take our "Hello, World" example from above and assume we want to
+switch the entropy coding algorithm from ANS to Range Coding. But we don't want to
+look for a new library or change how we represent entropy *models* and compressed data.
+Luckily, we only have to modify a few lines of code:
+
+```python
+import constriction
+import numpy as np
+
+# Same representation of message and entropy model as in the previous example:
+message = np.array([6, 10, -4, 2, 5, 2, 1, 0, 2], dtype=np.int32)
+entropy_model = constriction.stream.model.QuantizedGaussian(-50, 50, 3.2, 9.6)
+
+# Let's use a Range coder now:
+encoder = constriction.stream.queue.RangeEncoder()         # <-- CHANGED LINE
+encoder.encode(message, entropy_model)          # <-- (slightly) CHANGED LINE
+
+compressed = encoder.get_compressed()
+print(f"compressed representation: {compressed}")
+print(f"(in binary: {[bin(word) for word in compressed]})")
+
+decoder = constriction.stream.queue.RangeDecoder(compressed) #<--CHANGED LINE
+decoded = decoder.decode(entropy_model, 9) # (decodes 9 symbols)
+assert np.all(decoded == message)
+```
+
+### Complex Entropy Models
+
+This time, let's keep the entropy coding algorithm as it is but make the entropy *model*
+more complex. We'll encode the first 5 symbols of the message again with a
+`QuantizedGaussian` distribution, but this time we'll use individual model parameters
+(means and standard deviations) for each of the 5 symbols. For the remaining 4 symbols,
+we'll use a fixed categorical distribution, just to make it more interesting:
+
+```python
+import constriction
+import numpy as np
+
+# Same message as above, but a complex entropy model consisting of two parts:
+message = np.array([6,   10,   -4,   2,   5,    2, 1, 0, 2], dtype=np.int32)
+means   = np.array([2.3,  6.1, -8.5, 4.1, 1.3], dtype=np.float64)
+stds    = np.array([6.2,  5.3,  3.8, 3.2, 4.7], dtype=np.float64)
+entropy_model1 = constriction.stream.model.QuantizedGaussian(-50, 50)
+entropy_model2 = constriction.stream.model.Categorical(np.array(
+    [0.2, 0.5, 0.3], dtype=np.float64))  # Probabilities of the symbols 0,1,2.
+
+# Simply encode both parts in sequence with their respective models:
+encoder = constriction.stream.queue.RangeEncoder()
+encoder.encode(message[0:5], entropy_model1, means, stds) # per-symbol params.
+encoder.encode(message[5:9], entropy_model2)
+
+compressed = encoder.get_compressed()
+print(f"compressed representation: {compressed}")
+print(f"(in binary: {[bin(word) for word in compressed]})")
+
+decoder = constriction.stream.queue.RangeDecoder(compressed)
+decoded_part1 = decoder.decode(entropy_model1, means, stds)
+decoded_part2 = decoder.decode(entropy_model2, 4)
+assert np.all(np.concatenate((decoded_part1, decoded_part2)) == message)
+```
+
+You can define even more complex entropy models by providing an arbitrary Python
+function for the cumulative distribution function (see
+[`CustomModel`](https://bamler-lab.github.io/constriction/apidoc/python/stream/model.html#constriction.stream.model.CustomModel) and
+[`ScipyModel`](https://bamler-lab.github.io/constriction/apidoc/python/stream/model.html#constriction.stream.model.CustomModel)). The
+`constriction` library provides wrappers that turn your models into *exactly*
+invertible fixed-point arithmetic since even tiny rounding errors could otherwise
+completely break an entropy coding algorithm.
+
+### Exercise
+
+We've shown examples of ANS coding with a simple entropy model, of
+Range Coding with the same simple entropy model, and of Range coding with a complex
+entropy model. One combination is still missing: ANS coding
+with the complex entropy model from the last example above. This should be no problem
+now, so try it out yourself:
+
+- In the last example above, change both "queue.RangeEncoder" and "queue.RangeDecoder"
+  to "stack.AnsCoder" (ANS uses the same data structure for both encoding and decoding).
+- Then change both occurrences of `.encode(...)` to `.encode_reverse(...)` (since ANS
+  operates as a stack, i.e., last-in-first-out, we encode the symbols in reverse order
+  so that we can decode them in their normal order).
+- Finally, there's one slightly subtle change: when encoding the message, switch the
+  order of the two lines that encode `message[0:5]` and `message[5:9]`, respectively.
+  Do *not* change the order of decoding though. This is again necessary because ANS
+  operates as a stack.
+
+Congratulations, you've successfully implemented your first own compression scheme with
+`constriction`.

+## What's With the Name?
 
-# Entropy Coders for Research and Production
-
-The `constriction` library provides a set of composable entropy coding algorithms with a
-focus on correctness, versatility, ease of use, compression performance, and
-computational efficiency. The goals of `constriction` are three-fold:
-
-1. **to facilitate research on novel lossless and lossy compression methods** by
-   providing a *composable* set of primitives (e.g., you can can easily switch out a
-   Range Coder for an ANS coder without having to find a new library or change how you
-   represent exactly invertible entropy models);
-2. **to simplify the transition from research code to deployed software** by providing
-   similar APIs and binary compatible entropy coders for both Python (for rapid
-   prototyping on research code) and Rust (for turning successful prototypes into
-   standalone binaries, libraries, or WebAssembly modules); and
-3. **to serve as a teaching resource** by providing a variety of entropy coding
-   primitives within a single consistent framework. Check out our [additional teaching
-   material](https://robamler.github.io/teaching/compress21/) from a university course
-   on data compression, which contains some problem sets where you use `constriction`
-   (with solutions).
-
-**More Information:** [project website](https://bamler-lab.github.io/constriction)
-
-**Live demo:** [here's a web app](https://robamler.github.io/linguistic-flux-capacitor)
-that started out as a machine-learning research project in Python and was later turned
-into a web app by using `constriction` in a WebAssembly module).
-
-## Quick Start
-
-### Installing `constriction` for Python
-
-```bash
-pip install constriction~=0.3.0
-```
-
-### Hello, World
-
-You'll mostly use the `stream` submodule, which provides stream codes (like Range
-Coding or ANS). The following example shows a simple encoding-decoding round trip. More
-complex entropy models and other entropy coders are also supported, see section
-"More Examples" below.
-
-```python
-import constriction
-import numpy as np
-
-message = np.array([6, 10, -4, 2, 5, 2, 1, 0, 2], dtype=np.int32)
-
-# Define an i.i.d. entropy model (see below for more complex models):
-entropy_model = constriction.stream.model.QuantizedGaussian(-50, 50, 3.2, 9.6)
-
-# Let's use an ANS coder in this example. See below for a Range Coder example.
-encoder = constriction.stream.stack.AnsCoder()
-encoder.encode_reverse(message, entropy_model)
-
-compressed = encoder.get_compressed()
-print(f"compressed representation: {compressed}")
-print(f"(in binary: {[bin(word) for word in compressed]})")
-
-decoder = constriction.stream.stack.AnsCoder(compressed)
-decoded = decoder.decode(entropy_model, 9) # (decodes 9 symbols)
-assert np.all(decoded == message)
-```
-
-## More Examples
-
-### Switching Out the Entropy Coding Algorithm
-
-Let's take our "Hello, World" example from above and assume we want to
-switch the entropy coding algorithm from ANS to Range Coding. But we don't want to
-look for a new library or change how we represent entropy *models* and compressed data.
-Luckily, we only have to modify a few lines of code:
-
-```python
-import constriction
-import numpy as np
-
-# Same representation of message and entropy model as in the previous example:
-message = np.array([6, 10, -4, 2, 5, 2, 1, 0, 2], dtype=np.int32)
-entropy_model = constriction.stream.model.QuantizedGaussian(-50, 50, 3.2, 9.6)
-
-# Let's use a Range coder now:
-encoder = constriction.stream.queue.RangeEncoder()         # <-- CHANGED LINE
-encoder.encode(message, entropy_model)          # <-- (slightly) CHANGED LINE
-
-compressed = encoder.get_compressed()
-print(f"compressed representation: {compressed}")
-print(f"(in binary: {[bin(word) for word in compressed]})")
-
-decoder = constriction.stream.queue.RangeDecoder(compressed) #<--CHANGED LINE
-decoded = decoder.decode(entropy_model, 9) # (decodes 9 symbols)
-assert np.all(decoded == message)
-```
-
-### Complex Entropy Models
-
-This time, let's keep the entropy coding algorithm as it is but make the entropy *model*
-more complex. We'll encode the first 5 symbols of the message again with a
-`QuantizedGaussian` distribution, but this time we'll use individual model parameters
-(means and standard deviations) for each of the 5 symbols. For the remaining 4 symbols,
-we'll use a fixed categorical distribution, just to make it more interesting:
-
-```python
-import constriction
-import numpy as np
-
-# Same message as above, but a complex entropy model consisting of two parts:
-message = np.array([6,   10,   -4,   2,   5,    2, 1, 0, 2], dtype=np.int32)
-means   = np.array([2.3,  6.1, -8.5, 4.1, 1.3], dtype=np.float64)
-stds    = np.array([6.2,  5.3,  3.8, 3.2, 4.7], dtype=np.float64)
-entropy_model1 = constriction.stream.model.QuantizedGaussian(-50, 50)
-entropy_model2 = constriction.stream.model.Categorical(np.array(
-    [0.2, 0.5, 0.3], dtype=np.float64))  # Probabilities of the symbols 0,1,2.
-
-# Simply encode both parts in sequence with their respective models:
-encoder = constriction.stream.queue.RangeEncoder()
-encoder.encode(message[0:5], entropy_model1, means, stds) # per-symbol params.
-encoder.encode(message[5:9], entropy_model2)
-
-compressed = encoder.get_compressed()
-print(f"compressed representation: {compressed}")
-print(f"(in binary: {[bin(word) for word in compressed]})")
-
-decoder = constriction.stream.queue.RangeDecoder(compressed)
-decoded_part1 = decoder.decode(entropy_model1, means, stds)
-decoded_part2 = decoder.decode(entropy_model2, 4)
-assert np.all(np.concatenate((decoded_part1, decoded_part2)) == message)
-```
-
-You can define even more complex entropy models by providing an arbitrary Python
-function for the cumulative distribution function (see
-[`CustomModel`](https://bamler-lab.github.io/constriction/apidoc/python/stream/model.html#constriction.stream.model.CustomModel) and
